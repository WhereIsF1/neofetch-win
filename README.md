# neofetch-win #

Simple, ultra-lightweight neofetch clone for Windows 10+ written in C++ and installable through winget. The executable is just ~ 100KB and requires no dependencies other than the MS Visual C++ redists (which should be installed already, and if they're not my installer will take care of that for you :)

**Specific architectures:**
```
msbuild.exe /clp:ErrorsOnly /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x86      # x86 (32-bit)
